### Why are we playing capture the flag in such a large area??

Typically, capture the flag is about running as fast as possible. But by making the map larger, it opens the opportunity to sneak past enemies, call for backup, coordinate real strategies, and make friends in a behind-enemy-lines pincer movement. Of course though, there will still be plenty of running.

# Where and When
1:00 PM @ Golden Gate Park. Map pin will be sent on partiful.

# Map

_Note: the map has been modified since the last text blast to exclude Kezar drive so we're not being unsafe._

# Rules

## Flags
Each divided team will collectively decide where they want to put their flag within the boundary. The flag circle must encompass a area with circumfrence of `21m`[^2]. Must have 3 meters of clearance on all sides of impassible brush or walls/obstacles. The area around the flag is a safe zone (you canâ€™t be tagged). Each team will have two flags in the center of their flag circle[^1].

## Tagging/Jail
If a player is tagged, they must go to jail. A teammate (a jail breaker) may free jailed players by running into the enemy jail circle. One jail breaker entering the circle will free all jailed teammates.

Everyone besides jail breaker gets a free walk back. Freed tagged players must return to their team's side before doing anything else.

Each team will decide where they want to put their jail zone within the boundary. The jail zone must have the same clearance rules as the flag circle. It must also be placed within eyeshot of the flag circle.

A jail breaker is safe within the flag circle, but does not get a free walk back, and is unsafe after leaving the flag circle.[^3]

## Out of bounds
Going out of bounds intentionally or unintentionally (being chased out) results in being automatically tagged + jailed.

To not interfere with people trying to have a nice day in the park, entering bystanders play areas for spikeball/volleyball/soccer, running into bystanders, or stepping on picnic stuff counts as out of bounds, and counts as being tagged as above.

## Additonal
If someone is fleeing a flag circle with a flag in hand, and then becomes tagged, the flag _must_ be returned by the tagger within 5 minutes. If not, the flag counts as scored[^4].

## Vibes
This is about having fun, while winning is lit, all players reserve the right to say "it's not a big deal, let's do the thing that makes the vibes nicer". Keep your vibe-dar on and listen if something you're doing is not making the vibe lit.

## Winning
The game ends when one team has successfully captured all of the other team's flags and brought both back to their side, or have the most flags when the timer ends (60 minutes) 

[^1]: We have multiple flags in play so that while one flag is being returned/stolen, a team is not blocked significantly from being able to score a different flag.
[^2]: Flag circles and Jail circles exist so create clear well defined boundaries with which you can't puppy guard. Puppy guarding means being really close to the objective making it impossible to enter.
[^3]: We make a jail breaker still vulnerable so they have the option of doing hail mary play of jail break -> flag capture. If they also got a free walk back, they would not be able to flag capture.
[^4]: We enforce returning because a dropped flag has no well-defined flag circle, so no puppy-guarding is hard to enforce. We auto-score flags not returned sufficiently soon to make sure you can't just block scoring by returning flags slowly.
